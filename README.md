# JS Basics Learning Inventory

Embarking on a journey into the foundational aspects of JavaScript, my intent is to cement a solid understanding of the language's core concepts, refine my coding techniques, and explore the building blocks of web development. As I dive deep into JavaScript basics daily, this repository encapsulates my learning milestones and stands as a record of the essential coding patterns and practices I've adopted. While this is primarily my learning diary, I welcome fellow learners and enthusiasts to explore and share insights.
